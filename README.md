# NucleArmor
 Minecraft Forge mod, which adds powerful, uranium powered armor set.

When powered and a full set equipped this armor grants immunity to some damage types.
Also parts of the armor provide effects when equipped along with powered chestplate.
But beware when the nuclear fuel depletes the effects wear off and eventually negative effects are applied.

Important: this mod does not have any dependencies but requires another mod, which adds uranium and steel ingots, to function properly (e.g. Immersive Engineering).

Parts of armor can be repaired with steel except for chestplate which does not require "repairs" it needs "refueling" with uranium (works the same as repairing - put chestplate and uranium ingot in anvil).
